## Projects Description
1. **Chatroom**:

The Chatroom application is a real-time messaging platform that enables users to sign up, sign in, and sign out securely. Users can exchange messages with specific individuals or communicate with all registered users in a shared chatroom environment. The application features a user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless interactions, allowing users to engage in one-on-one conversations as well as group discussions. All these functionalities are implemented using the Firebase Realtime Database.

3. **Speedometer**:

The Speedometer application is designed to measure and display the current speed of the user's device in real-time. Upon activation, the app utilizes the device's GPS capabilities to track movement and present the speed in a clear and user-friendly interface. Users can set a speed limit, which is stored in Shared Preferences, and the app will monitor the speed continuously. 

In the event of exceeding the set speed limit, the application records the incident in a SQLite database, capturing essential information such as geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), speed, and a timestamp. Additionally, the app changes the color of the activity screen to indicate the speed limit breach and provides an audible warning through the TextToSpeech Engine, ensuring that users are promptly alerted to potential dangers. This project not only enhances user awareness while driving but also serves as a practical implementation of mobile application development concepts.
